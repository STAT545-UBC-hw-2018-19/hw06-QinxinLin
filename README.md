## Reflection

This assignment is tough for me and extremely time consuming. I spent a lot time on character data. I find some questins are very difficult for me to solve. Google is a good tool which helps me to solve a lot questions. In the writing function part, [this tutorial](http://stat545.com/block012_function-regress-lifeexp-on-year.html) is quite useful for me. It is a relatively easy part for me. In the third part, I struggled for finding interesting countries with large parameter differnce between linear model and robust model. Also, tutorial [Split-Apply-Combine](http://stat545.com/block024_group-nest-split-map.html) must read. Without it, I cannot finish this task.
